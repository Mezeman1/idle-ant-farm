# Idle Ant Farm

> First time creating an idle game.
> This is a simple idle game where you can buy ants and they will generate resources for you.
> I tried making it a bit more interesting by also adding visual representation of the ants and resources.
> Future updates will add a lot more things to do and more interesting mechanics.
>
> I love idle games, so I will probably keep working on this for a while.
